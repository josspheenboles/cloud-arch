Task1:
Write a Python script that does the following:
	Assign the name of your favorite cloud provider to a variable.
	Print a welcome message including the provider name.
	Create a list of three cloud services (e.g., S3, EC2, Lambda).
	Print the list and its length.
	Create a dictionary with keys name, region, and services (use the list from the 	previous step as the value for services).
	Print the dictionary in a readable format.
Task2:
You are building a simple region checker.
Write a program that prompts the user to input a region (e.g., us-west-2).
If the region is us-east-1, print “You are in the default region.”
Otherwise, print “Region selected: <input>.”


Bounce:
Create a script that does the following:
Prompts the user to enter a list of services separated by commas (e.g., S3, EC2, Lambda).
Iterates over the list and prints each service with its estimated hourly rate (use a predefined dictionary).
Adds a feature to calculate the total cost if all services are used for a specified number of hours.
